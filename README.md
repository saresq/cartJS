# Cart JS

A simple React Cart with ability to add products, change quantities and removing products, all using React Context.

## Installation

Easy to run, just clone it, and then run:

```bash
  npm i
  npm start
```

## Things not present that would be nice in the future:

- Adding Pack creation and editing
- A Homepage listing all products
- Calculating discount based on quantity
- Ability to sign up / sign in
- Checkout page with payments info
- Backend to ABM products/packs and store carts from users
- Dockerization

Due to time, they are not currently developed.
